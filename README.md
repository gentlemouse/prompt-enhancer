> 心有灵犀一点通

A browser extension that **dynamically analyzes** your prompt and applies the **right optimization strategy** before sending it to any AI. Works on ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, DeepSeek, and 50+ other AI platforms. Zero config, install and go.

---

## Why Lynx?

We've all been there — you type a quick question into ChatGPT, get a mediocre answer, then spend 5 minutes rewriting your prompt with better structure, clearer constraints, and specific output requirements. *Then* the AI gives you what you actually wanted.

**The quality of AI output is directly tied to the quality of your input.** But writing great prompts is a skill, and doing it every single time is exhausting.

Lynx solves this by acting as an **intelligent layer between you and the AI**. But unlike simple "make it longer" tools, it actually **understands what your prompt needs** and applies a tailored strategy.

### What makes it different?

| Feature | Simple prompt tools | Lynx |
|---------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Optimization approach | One-size-fits-all template | Dynamic strategy based on 15+ signal dimensions |
| Short commands | Bloats them unnecessarily | Light polish — keeps them concise |
| Already good prompts | Rewrites them anyway | Detects good structure, only fine-tunes |
| Follow-up questions | Treats as standalone | Understands conversation context (5-turn memory) |
| Corrections ("also add...") | Ignores intent | Merges new constraints into original prompt |

---

## How It Works

When you press `Cmd+Shift+E` (or click the button), Lynx runs your input through a 3-stage pipeline:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A["✍️ Your Prompt"] -->|"Cmd+Shift+E"| B["🔍 Analyze"]
    B --> C["⚡ Strategize"]
    C --> D["✅ Enhanced"]

    style A fill:#f9f9f9,stroke:#333
    style D fill:#d4edda,stroke:#28a745
```

### Stage 1: Multi-dimensional Analysis

The analyzer examines your prompt across **5 dimensions** simultaneously:

| Dimension | What it detects | Example |
|-----------|----------------|---------|
| **Task Type** | 8 categories: Code, Writing, Analysis, Q&A, Planning, Research, Chat, Extraction | "Write a sorting algorithm" → `CODE` |
| **Complexity** | Chain-of-thought signals, reflection markers, multi-part questions | "Analyze the pros and cons" → `DEEP_THINKING` |
| **Context** | New topic vs. follow-up vs. correction (using session memory) | "Can you elaborate on that?" → `Follow-up` |
| **Structure** | Whether the prompt already has role/task/constraints | "Role: ... Task: ..." → `Well-structured` |
| **Language** | Chinese or English (auto-detected) | Preserves original language |

### Stage 2: Strategy Selection

Based on the analysis, the engine selects **1 of 5 strategies** — each designed for a specific scenario:

```mermaid

    A["Incoming Prompt"] --> B{"Correction?\n'add...', 'remove...', 'change...'"}
    B -->|Yes| C["📎 CONSTRAINT APPEND\nMerge new requirements\ninto existing prompt"]
    B -->|No| D{"Follow-up?\nReferences previous context"}
    D -->|Yes| E["🎯 INTENT CLARIFY\nResolve ambiguity,\nkeep conversational"]
    D -->|No| F{"Short?\n< 50 characters"}
    F -->|Yes| G["💬 LIGHT POLISH\nMinimal refinement,\ndon't over-expand"]
    F -->|No| H{"Well-structured?\nHas role/task/constraints"}
    H -->|Yes| I["✨ SHARPEN\nFine-tune wording,\npreserve structure"]
    H -->|No| J["🏗️ STRUCTURAL REWRITE\nFull restructure with\nrole, task, constraints"]

    style C fill:#fff3cd,stroke:#856404
    style E fill:#cce5ff,stroke:#004085
    style G fill:#d4edda,stroke:#155724
    style I fill:#e2d5f1,stroke:#6f42c1
    style J fill:#f8d7da,stroke:#721c24
```

### Stage 3: Prompt Building

The selected strategy generates a **specialized system prompt** that instructs the LLM exactly how to optimize your input — then the enhanced version replaces your original text in the input box.

## See It in Action

Here's what each strategy does with real examples:

### Strategy 1: Light Polish

> For short, clear commands that just need minor refinements.

| | Content |
|---|---------|
| **Before** | `Translate this paragraph` |
| **After** | `Translate the following paragraph into English. Preserve the original tone and style. For technical terms, keep the original in parentheses.` |
| **What changed** | Added target language, style preservation, and terminology handling — without bloating it. |

### Strategy 2: Structural Rewrite

> For complex requests that need a clear framework.

| | Content |
|---|---------|
| **Before** | `Help me write a Python web scraper for news sites` |
| **After** | `Role: Senior Python developer experienced with web scraping.`<br><br>`Task: Build a news website scraper with the following requirements:`<br>`1. Target: configurable news site URLs`<br>`2. Extract: title, date, author, body text`<br>`3. Handle pagination automatically`<br><br>`Constraints:`<br>`- Use requests + BeautifulSoup`<br>`- Implement rate limiting (1 req/sec)`<br>`- Handle network errors gracefully`<br><br>`Output: Complete, runnable Python script with usage example.` |
| **What changed** | Restructured into role/task/constraints/output framework, making the request unambiguous. |

### Strategy 3: Intent Clarify

> For follow-up questions in a conversation.

| | Content |
|---|---------|
| **Before** | `Can you go into more detail on that?` |
| **After** | `Please elaborate on the "data storage architecture" section from your previous response. Specifically, explain the trade-offs between SQL and NoSQL for this use case, and recommend which to use.` |
| **What changed** | Resolved vague reference ("that"), specified exactly what to elaborate on. |

### Strategy 4: Sharpen

> For prompts that are already well-written but could be tighter.

| | Content |
|---|---------|
| **Before** | `Role: You are a marketing expert.`<br>`Task: Write ad copy for our new product.`<br>`Requirements: Make it engaging and concise.` |
| **After** | `Role: You are a senior marketing copywriter with 10+ years in consumer electronics.`<br>`Task: Write 3 variations of ad copy for our new wireless earbuds.`<br>`Requirements:`<br>`- Tone: energetic, youth-oriented`<br>`- Length: 50-80 words each`<br>`- Include one clear call-to-action per variation`<br>`- Avoid: generic superlatives, competitor comparisons` |
| **What changed** | Sharpened vague terms ("engaging") into specific criteria, added negative constraints. |

### Strategy 5: Constraint Append

> For corrections and additions to a previous prompt.

| | Content |
|---|---------|
| **Before** | `Add error handling and make it async` |
| **After** | `Based on the previous code, please make the following modifications:`<br>`1. Convert all synchronous I/O operations to async/await`<br>`2. Add comprehensive error handling:`<br>`   - Network timeout: retry 3 times with exponential backoff`<br>`   - Invalid data: log warning and skip`<br>`   - Permission error: raise immediately`<br>`3. Keep all existing functionality unchanged.` |
| **What changed** | Integrated corrections into a complete, unambiguous modification request with specifics. |
